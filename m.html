	<p> My name is Miguel Alvarez, I am 17 years old and I am a senior at Metro Tech High School. I am currently taking Computer Maintenance at Metro Tech, having took Computer Networking already. 
	<p> I am planning on attending either NAU or Gateway Community College. I plan to major in Computer Science or Cyber Security. </p>
	<p>I plan on majoring in either those two majors because I love computers and how they work. I love the fact that I have to learn a whole new language to be able to understand what computers actually say to each other.  </p>
